🔊 AI-Based Noise Classifier
Classifying Environmental Sounds using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

The AI-Based Noise Classifier is a machine learning project that identifies and classifies environmental sounds such as traffic noise, construction sounds, human speech, sirens, rain, and more.

This system uses audio feature extraction techniques and deep learning models to automatically detect the type of noise from an input audio file.

🎯 Problem Statement

Environmental noise pollution affects urban life, health, and productivity. Manual monitoring is inefficient and time-consuming.

This project builds an AI-powered automated noise classification system that:

Detects different types of environmental sounds

Helps in smart city monitoring

Can be integrated into IoT devices

Assists in noise pollution analysis
